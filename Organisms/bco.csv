class;term;comment
generically dependent continuant;taxonomic inventory;A list of names ascribed to biological entities of specified organismal scope recorded over some defined spatial and temporal scope following a described sampling protocol and sampling effort, potentially including values indicating abundance or biomass of the biological entities
material entity;museum;An institution that cares for (conserves) a collection of artifacts and other objects of scientific, artistic, cultural, or historical importance.
occurrent;submitting process;A planned process whereby a person submits a material sample to an organization.
role;material target of observation role;A role that is borne by some material entity and is realized by the material entity being the input of an observing process.
occurrent;observing process;A process in which a person or machine sees or detects a material entity and selects it as worthy of observation, and which has as output an information content entity about the selected material entity.
generically dependent continuant;locality description;An information artifact that is about a spatio-temporal region at which a process (such as collecting process, observing process, or material sampling process) occured.
occurrent;taxonomic inventory process;A planned process by which a taxonomic inventory is created.
material entity;material target of observation;A material entity that has a target of observation role, that is, a material entity that is the input of some observing process.
occurrent;adventitious taxonomic inventory process;A taxonomic inventory process in which taxon occurrences are recorded as co-variates of another study, or by happenstance, and later compiled as a taxonomic inventory.
occurrent;machine observation process;An observing process in which the observing entity consists of one or more machines.
occurrent;compilation taxonomic inventory process;A taxonomic inventory process in which a list of taxa of interest is assembled from various combinations of existing taxonomic inventories, rather than generated de novo from observations or samples.
object aggregate;museum collection;An object aggregate that has as member part a material sample that is located in museum as a result of a process of curation.
occurrent;opportunistic search taxonomic inventory process;A taxonomic inventory process that is a more casual reporting of occurrences of taxa of interest, still intended to be a comprehensive accounting of the taxa of interest, but with no pre-specified investment of effort nor planned trajectory for discovery, thus of often idiosyncratic length or spatial scope.
object aggregate;organismal museum collection;A museum collection that has as member part a material sample that was derived from an organism.
occurrent;trap or sample taxonomic inventory process;A taxonomic inventory process that is typically restricted in geospatial extent that involves either the physical extraction of some evidence of the presence of the taxa of interest, such as a whole organisms, scat, fur, other material samples or information artifacts such as photographs or sound recordings
occurrent;human observation process;An observing process in which the observing entity consists of one or more humans.
occurrent;restricted search taxonomic inventory process;A taxonomic inventory process that is restricted to plots, transects, or points, in which a person or group of people is comprehensively covering the entire area, usually with a well-described survey time or pace. The search is restricted to a defined and human-scale geospatial area (usually traversable within a time course of less than a day) within which there is an expectation of a comprehensive accounting of the taxonomic items of interest.
generically dependent continuant;identification assertion;A data item that is the output of a taxonomic identification process and associates some organismal entity with a taxon or taxa.
occurrent;open search taxonomic inventory process;A taxonomic inventory process in which the search is restricted within a larger defined geographic area, but where effort isn't even or complete across the region, and thus not a comprehensive accounting of taxa of interest. Temporal duration is typically longer than restricted searches, lasting hours to several days.
