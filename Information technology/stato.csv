generically dependent continuant;Fagan nomogram;Fagan nomogram is a graph plotting pre-test probabilities, likelyhood ratios and post-test probabilities on 3 parallel axis. The plot was first proposed by Fagan in 1975 as a way to visualize Baye's Theorem data where P(D) is the probability that the patient has the disease before the test. P(D|T) is the probability that the patient has the disease after the test result. P(T|D) is the probability of the test result if the patient has the disease, and P(T|D̄) is the probability of the test result if the patient does not have the disease. With this terminology the usefulness of both positive and negative test results can be assessed. A line drawn from P(D) on the right through the ratio of P(T|D) to P(T|D̄) gives P(D|T) on the left of the nomogram.

It can be calculated from the pedigree, but it is also possible to calculate the relationship matrix from genotypes at genetic markers such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Elements of the genomic relationship matrix are estimates of the realized proportion of the genome that two individuals share, whereas the pedigree-derived relationship matrix is the expectation of this proportion.

process;sign test;The sign test is a non-parametric hypothesis test used to assess whether the median of a single population is equal to a specified value, typically referred to as the null hypothesis. The sign test is particularly useful when the data are not normally distributed or when the assumptions required for parametric tests are not met. Note that the 'sign test' is related but different from the "Wilcoxon signed rank test'. Sign test: It does not assume any specific distribution for the data. It only requires paired data and makes no assumptions about the shape of the underlying distribution. Wilcoxon signed-rank test: It assumes that the differences between paired observations come from a symmetric distribution. It's also more powerful than the sign test when the distribution is continuous and symmetric.

generically dependent continuant;I-squared;The quantity called I2, describes the percentage of total variation across studies that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance. I2 can be readily calculated from basic results obtained from a typical meta-analysis as I2 = 100%×(Q - df)/Q, where Q is Cochran's heterogeneity statistic and df the degrees of freedom. Negative values of I2 are put equal to zero so that I2 lies between 0% and 100%. A value of 0% indicates no observed heterogeneity, and larger values show increasing heterogeneity. Unlike Cochran's Q, it does not inherently depend upon the number of studies considered. A confidence interval for I² is constructed using either i) the iterative non-central chi-squared distribution method of Hedges and Piggott (2001). or ii) the test-based method of Higgins and Thompson (2002). The non-central chi-square method is currently the method of choice (Higgins, personal communication, 2006) – it is computed if the 'exact' option is selected.

The state or the measurement can be either continuous or discrete. The term “state space” originated in 1960s in the area of control engineering (Kalman, 1960). SSM provides a general framework for analyzing deterministic and stochastic dynamical systems that are measured or observed through a stochastic process.

A p-value for two-sided test interprets 'at least as far from' with both the direction of 'greater than' and the direction of 'less than'. For hypothesis test interpretation, the two-tailed p-value is compared to the alpha setting divided by 2.

process;maximum likelihood estimation;maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is a method of estimating the parameters of a statistical model, given observations. MLE attempts to find the parameter values that maximize the likelihood function, given the observations. The method of maximum likelihood is based on the likelihood function, {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}(\theta \,.x)} {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}(\theta \,.x)}. We are given a statistical model, i.e. a family of distributions {\displaystyle \{f(\cdot \,.\theta )\mid \theta \in \Theta \}} {\displaystyle \{f(\cdot \,.\theta )\mid \theta \in \Theta \}}, where {\displaystyle \theta } \theta denotes the (possibly multi-dimensional) parameter for the model. The method of maximum likelihood finds the values of the model parameter, {\displaystyle \theta } \theta , that maximize the likelihood function, {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}(\theta \,.x)} {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}(\theta \,.x)}. I

The random forest procedure is a meta estimator that fits a number of classifying decision trees on various sub-samples of the dataset (it operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time) and use averaging to improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting. The sub-sample size is always the same as the original input sample size but the samples are drawn with replacement if bootstrap=True (default). The random forest procedure outputs the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.

The risk difference is straightforward to interpret: it describes the actual difference in the observed risk of events between experimental and control interventions.
generically dependent continuant;narrow sense heritability;A particularly important component of the genetic variance is the additive variance, Var(A), which is the variance due to the average effects (additive effects) of the alleles. Since each parent passes a single allele per locus to each offspring, parent-offspring resemblance depends upon the average effect of single alleles. Additive variance represents, therefore, the genetic component of variance responsible for parent-offspring resemblance. The additive genetic portion of the phenotypic variance is known as Narrow-sense heritability and is defined as: h2 = Var(A)/Var(P)
process;one sample t-test;one sample t-test is a kind of Student's t-test which evaluates if a given sample can be reasonably assumed to be taken from the population. The test compares the sample statistic (m) to the population parameter (M). The one sample t-test is the small sample analog of the z test, which is suitable for large samples.

generically dependent continuant;heritability;In a planned experiment where to covariance (genotype x environment) can be controlled and held at 0, the heritability is defined as the ratio of the variance of the genotypic variables to the variance of the phenotypic variables. H2 = Var(G)/Var(P) H2 is the broad-sense heritability. This reflects all the genetic contributions to a population's phenotypic variance including additive, dominant, and epistatic (multi-genic interactions), as well as maternal and paternal effects, where individuals are directly affected by their parents' phenotype, for example, milk production in mammals.
generically dependent continuant;covariance;The covariance is a measurement data item about the strength of correlation between a set (2 or more) of random variables. The covariance is obtained by forming: cov(X,Y)=E([X-E(X)][Y-E(Y)] where E(X), E(Y) is the expected value (mean) of variable X and Y respectively. covariance is symmetric so cov(X,Y)=cov(Y,X). The covariance is usefull when looking at the variance of the sum of the 2 random variables since: var(X+Y) = var(X) +var(Y) +2cov(X,Y) The covariance cov(x,y) is used to obtain the coefficient of correlation cor(x,y) by normalizing (dividing) cov(x,y) but the product of the standard deviations of x and y.
generically dependent continuant;L'Abbe plot;The L’Abbé plot was introduced in 1987 in the context of meta-analyses of clinical trials with dichotomous (binary) outcomes, as a plot of observed risks in the treatment group against observed risks in the control group. Another formulation is that it plots the event rate in the experimental (intervention) group against the event rate in the control group, as an aid to exploring the heterogeneity of effect estimates within a meta-analysis. It is diagram used in meta-analysis that compares the risks observed in the experimental and control arms of clinical trials. Each trial is located in the space of a diagram where the sizes of the circles indicate the sizes of the trials. Trials in which the experimental treatment had a higher risk than the control will be in the upper left of the plot. If risk in the both groups is the same the circle will fall on the line of equality. If the control treatment has a higher risk than the experimental treatment then the point will be in the lower right of the plot. It is often used as an indicator of heterogeneity and hence as an indicator of the likelihood that results from different trials can be validly combined. Named after Kristin L'Abbé.

generically dependent continuant;eta-squared;Eta-squared is a biased estimator of the variance explained by the model in the population (it estimates only the effect size in the sample). Eta-squared describes the ratio of variance explained in the dependent variable by a predictor while controlling for other predictors, making it analogous to the r2. This estimate shares the weakness with r2 that each additional variable will automatically increase the value of η2. In addition, it measures the variance explained of the sample, not the population, meaning that it will always overestimate the effect size, although the bias grows smaller as the sample grows larger.
generically dependent continuant;log normal distribution;a log-normal (or lognormal) distribution is a continuous probability distribution of a random variable whose logarithm is normally distributed. Thus, if the random variable {\displaystyle X} X is log-normally distributed, then {\displaystyle Y=\ln(X)} Y=\ln(X) has a normal distribution. Likewise, if {\displaystyle Y} Y has a normal distribution, then {\displaystyle X=\exp(Y)} X=\exp(Y) has a log-normal distribution. A random variable which is log-normally distributed takes only positive real values. The distribution is occasionally referred to as the Galton distribution or Galton's distribution, after Francis Galton.

In this design the treatment combinations are at the midpoints of edges of the process space and at the center. These designs are rotatable (or near rotatable) and require 3 levels of each factor. The designs have limited capability for orthogonal blocking compared to the central composite designs.
process;McNemar test;McNemar's test is a statistical test used on paired nominal data. It is applied to 2 × 2 contingency tables with a dichotomous trait, with matched pairs of subjects, to determine whether the row and column marginal frequencies are equal (that is, whether there is "marginal homogeneity"). It is named after Quinn McNemar, who introduced it in 1947. An application of the test in genetics is the transmission disequilibrium test for detecting linkage disequilibrium

The term Count Difference is used to specify the Absolute Difference is with respect to a count or number of items (such as number of events, platelet counts, sample size e.g. number of people in the group) to distinguish from differences in other types of statistics (mean difference, median difference, risk difference, etc.)
generically dependent continuant;relative difference;A statistic that is a difference between 1 and a ratio of the two quantities being compared. Relative Difference = 1 - ( a / b ). Because 1 - ( a / b ) is not equal to 1 - ( b / a ), Relative Difference may be expressed as "Relative Difference with respect to b" when referring to 1 - ( a / b ). The relative difference can also be defined as a statistic that is a ratio of the absolute difference (of the two quantities being compared) to the reference value (one of the quantities being compared). Relative Difference = ( b - a ) / ( b ) where b is the reference value and this may also be called "Relative Difference with respect to b".

Scott's pi is a kappa statistic for two raters that assumes the likelihood of each category for assignment is based on the same distribution of rater responses, leading to the use of squared arithmetic means of the marginal proportion of each assessment category as its estimate of "chance agreement." Pr(expected) is calculated using squared "joint proportions" which are squared arithmetic means of the marginal proportions of each assessment category, in contrast to Cohen's Kappa which uses squared geometric means. Scott's pi = ( p[a] - p[e] ) / ( 1 - p[e] ) where p[a] is the observed percent agreement and p[e] is the expected chance agreement expressed as the squared joint proportions of the marginal sums.

In a simple PPS design, these selection probabilities can then be used as the basis for Poisson sampling. However, this has the drawback of variable sample size, and different portions of the population may still be over- or under-represented due to chance variation in selections.

The F1-score is used as a measure of quality for classification algorithms and information retrieval strategies, where 1 represents the best precision and recall and 0 represents the worst precision and recall. A harmonic mean of a set of quantities is the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of the reciprocals of each quantity. The F score is thus calculated as 1 / (the arithmetic mean of the reciprocals), or: F = 1 / ( ( (1/recall) + (1/precision) ) / 2 ) F = 2*( (precision*recall) / (precision+recall) ) Recall is sensitivity STATO:0000233 Precision (PPV) is STATO:0000416

'Odds' and 'Odds ratio' are different terms. 'Odds' is a ratio of probabilities. 'Odds ratio' is a ratio of two different odds. Odds are calculated as p / (1-p) where p is the probability of event occurrence. When p = 0, the odds = 0. When p = 1, the odds may be expressed as not calculable or as "odds against = 0". Odds may be expressed as p:(1-p). Odds may be expressed as p:q where q = 1-p. Odds may be expressed as a:b where a and b are multiples of p and (1-p). Examples of different expressions of the same odds include 3:2, 3/2, 0.6:0.4, 0.6/0.4, and 1.5. Odds may be expressed as "odds for" or "odds in favor" (e.g. 1:5 for a "3" on a 6-sided die) or "odds against" (e.g. 5:1 against a "3" on a 6-sided die). The term "betting odds" used in gambling that involves financial amounts in the formulation is not an "Odds" in the definition of the Scientific Evidence Code System.

generically dependent continuant;Gini index;The Gini index, or Gini coefficient, is a statistical measure of dispersion which assesses the pattern of data in a frequency distribution, in particular it measures the inequality among values. Geometrically, the Gini index can be defined as the ratio of 2 areas delineated by 2 curves, the line of equality (curve 1) and the Lorenz curve (curve 2). The numerator of the ratio corresponds to the area defined between curve 1 and curve 2 , while the denominator corresponds to the entire area below curve 1. Mathematically, the Gini index is defined as half of the relative mean absolute difference. It was therefore originally used to assess income inequality and is named after the italian statistician Corrado Gini who published it in 1912.

generically dependent continuant;Weibull probability distribution;the Weibull probability distribution is continuous probabibility distribution which is used to model time to fail, time to repair and material strength in material science. In biomedicine, the Weibull probability is used to in determining 'hazard functions'. The 'location parameter' of the Weibull probability distribution can be used to define a failure-free zone. If the quantity X is a "time-to-failure", the Weibull distribution gives a distribution for which the failure rate is proportional to a power of time. The shape parameter, k, is that power plus one, and so this parameter can be interpreted directly as follows: A value of {\displaystyle k<1\,} {\displaystyle k<1\,} indicates that the failure rate decreases over time. This happens if there is significant "infant mortality", or defective items failing early and the failure rate decreasing over time as the defective items are weeded out of the population. In the context of the diffusion of innovations, this means negative word of mouth: the hazard function is a monotonically decreasing function of the proportion of adopters. A value of {\displaystyle k=1\,} {\displaystyle k=1\,} indicates that the failure rate is constant over time. This might suggest random external events are causing mortality, or failure. The Weibull distribution reduces to an exponential distribution. A value of {\displaystyle k>1\,} {\displaystyle k>1\,} indicates that the failure rate increases with time. This happens if there is an "aging" process, or parts that are more likely to fail as time goes on. In the context of the diffusion of innovations, this means positive word of mouth: the hazard function is a monotonically increasing function of the proportion of adopters. The function is first concave, then convex with an inflexion point at {\displaystyle (e^{1/k}-1)/e^{1/k},k>1\,} {\displaystyle (e^{1/k}-1)/e^{1/k},k>1\,}.

This ratio can be proved to be minimax ratio only under the assumption of LDA classifier with Gaussian distributions. The notion of minimax sampling is recently developed for a general class of classification rules, called class-wise smart classifiers.

The interpretation of stochastic dominance requires an assumption that the CDF of one group does not cross the CDF of the other. The null hypothesis for each pairwise comparison is that the probability of observing a randomly selected value from the first group that is larger than a randomly selected value from the second group equals one half. this null hypothesis corresponds to that of the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney rank-sum test. Like the rank-sum test, if the data can be assumed to be continuous, and the distributions are assumed identical except for a difference in location, Conover-Iman test may be understood as a test for median difference. conover.test accounts for tied ranks. The Conover-Iman test is strictly valid if and only if the corresponding Kruskal-Wallis null hypothesis is rejected.
process;Dunn’s multiple comparison test;Dunn’s Multiple Comparison Test is a post hoc (i.e. it’s run after an ANOVA) non parametric test (a “distribution free” test that doesn’t assume your data comes from a particular distribution). It is one of the least powerful of the multiple comparisons tests and can be a very conservative test–especially for larger numbers of comparisons. The Dunn is an alternative to the Tukey test when you only want to test for differences in a small subset of all possible pairs. For larger numbers of pairwise comparisons, use Tukey’s instead. Use Dunn’s when you choose to test a specific number of comparisons before you run the ANOVA and when you are not comparing to controls. If you are comparing to a control group, use the Dunnett test instead.

To understand limited replication, consider about experiments that may only allow a single representation of the new treatment, this limitation may be many times due to the cost associated with the experiment, limited resources, or limited number of new units that can be used in the experiment. In contrast, the existing treatments are referred as checks and are generally replicated multiple times. With augmented design one can estimate the following: a) Differences between checks and new treatments, b) Differences among new treatments, c) Differences among check treatments, and d) Differences among new and check treatments combined.

generically dependent continuant;strictly standardized mean difference;strictly standardized mean difference (SSMS) is a standardized mean difference which corresponds to the ratio of mean to the standard deviation of the difference between two groups. SSMD directly measures the magnitude of difference between two groups. SSMD is widely used in High Content Screen for hit selection and quality control. When the data is preprocessed using log-transformation as normally done in HTS experiments, SSMD is the mean of log fold change divided by the standard deviation of log fold change with respect to a negative reference. In other words, SSMD is the average fold change (on the log scale) penalized by the variability of fold change (on the log scale). For quality control, one index for the quality of an HTS assay is the magnitude of difference between a positive control and a negative reference in an assay plate. For hit selection, the size of effects of a compound (i.e., a small molecule or an siRNA) is represented by the magnitude of difference between the compound and a negative reference. SSMD directly measures the magnitude of difference between two groups. Therefore, SSMD can be used for both quality control and hit selection in HTS experiments.

A biplot is constructed by using the singular value decomposition (SVD) to obtain a low-rank approximation to a transformed version of the data matrix X, whose n rows are the samples (also called the cases, or objects), and whose p columns are the variables. The biplot was introduced by K. Ruben Gabriel (1971).
generically dependent continuant;Glass's delta;Glass's delta is an estimator of effect size which is similar to Cohen's d but where the denominator corresponds only to the standard deviation of the control group (or second group). It is considered less biais than the Cohen's d for estimating effect sizes based on means and distances between means.

It is a measure of how precise an estimate of a statistical parameter is. The standard error is the estimated standard deviation of an estimate. It measures the uncertainty associated with the estimate. Compared with the standard deviations of the underlying distribution, which are usually unknown, standard errors can be calculated from observed data.

In other words, if confidence intervals are constructed using a given confidence level in an infinite number of independent experiments, the proportion of those intervals that contain the true value of the parameter will match the confidence level. A probability measure of the reliability of an inferential statistical test that has been applied to sample data and which is provided along with the confidence interval for the output statistic.

In such configuration, each 'sub-plot' is itself divided into 'sub sub-plot', which then received the remainder of the treatments in completely randomized fashion. In the case of non-field based trials, the notion 'sub sub-plot' is a metaphor.

RPKM is a metric generated by ERANGE software tool as reported by Mortazi et al, in 2008. The metric has been enhanced and replaced by FPKM to better take into account splice variant. FKPM uses a statistical model to perform the computation. Recommended use: -RPKM measure may be used for gene count comparisons within a sample. -RPKM measure is NOT suited for between sample comparisons. -RPKM measure is NOT suited for Differential Expression analysis.
generically dependent continuant;Bayesian information criterion;Bayesian information criterion or Schwartz's Bayesian information criterion is a criterion for model selection among a finite set of models. It is based, in part, on the likelihood function and it is closely related to the Akaike information criterion (AIC). Given any two estimated models, the model with the lower value of BIC is the one to be preferred. The BIC is an increasing function of sigma e^2 and an increasing function of k. That is, unexplained variation in the dependent variable and the number of explanatory variables increase the value of BIC. Hence, lower BIC implies either fewer explanatory variables, better fit, or both.
generically dependent continuant;sub-plot number;a 'sub plot number' is a data item used to count and identify the actual piece of land located within a 'whole plot', in the case of real field based trials using a split-plot design, and received completely randomized treatments corresponding to the factor levels combinations of the remainder factors declared in the experiment. in the case of 'split-split plot design', sub-plots also receive treatments corresponding to a factor whose randomization is restriction. In such configuration, each 'sub-plot' is itself divided into 'sub sub-plot', which then received the remainder of the treatments in completely randomized fashion. In the case of non-field based trials, the notion 'sub-plot' is a metaphor.

generically dependent continuant;F-distribution;the F-distribution is a continuous probability distribution which arises in the testing of whether two observed samples have the same variance.
generically dependent continuant;Akaike information criterion;The Akaike information criterion (AIC) is a measure of the relative quality of a statistical model for a given set of data. As such, AIC provides a means for model selection. AIC is defined as: AIC = 2K - 2log(L) where K is the number of predictors and L is the maximized likelihood value. AIC deals with the trade-off between the goodness of fit of the model and the complexity of the model. It is founded on information theory: it offers a relative estimate of the information lost when a given model is used to represent the process that generates the data. AIC does not provide a test of a model in the sense of testing a null hypothesis. i.e. AIC can tell nothing about the quality of the model in an absolute sense. If all the candidate models fit poorly, AIC will not give any warning of that.
process;restricted randomization;Restricted randomization is a kind of randomization which is used or occured when hard to change factors exist in a study design. In other words, when complete randomization is not possible, a case of restricted randomization exists, for instance in the case of split-plot design. Restricted randomization allows intuitively poor allocations of treatments to experimental units to be avoided, while retaining the theoretical benefits of randomization. Restricted randomization can also result from an unplanned event and is then something that should be avoided. RandomizeR R package can be used to detect such events and assess the quality of randomization process.
process;factor analysis;Factor analysis is a dimension reduction data transformation that is used to describe variability among observed, correlated variables in terms of a potentially lower number of unobserved variables called factors. Factor analysis is related to principal component analysis (PCA), but the two are not identical. Both PCA and factor analysis aim to reduce the dimensionality of a set of data, but the approaches taken to do so are different for the two techniques. Factor analysis is clearly designed with the objective to identify certain unobservable factors from the observed variables, whereas PCA does not directly address this objective. at best, PCA provides an approximation to the required factors.

realizable entity;split-plot design;a split-plot design is kind of factorial design which is used when running a full factorial completely randomized design is inpractical, either for cost or practicalities (e.g. equipment, fields), in other words, when a restricted randomization has to be applied. A split-plot design is used whenever practioners fix the level of 'hard to change factor' and run all the combinations of the other factors. The hard to change factor is also refered to as the 'whole plot' factor, while the remainders of the factors are refered to as 'split plot factor'. Performing a split-plot design therefore means fixing one factor level, and then applying the treatments formed by the cartesian products of the levels for the other factors. A mininum of 2 factors are required and one being applied before the other(s).
generically dependent continuant;regression coefficient;a regression coefficient is a measure of association that is used as the coefficient of an independent variable in a regression model, of the dependent variable, which is linear in its parameters. A value of zero means no association. The sign (positive or negative) reflects the direction of association. a regression coefficient is a measure of association generated by a type of data transformation called a regression, which aims to model a response variable by expression the predictor variables as part of a function where variable terms are modified by a number. A regression coefficient is one such number.
generically dependent continuant;Spearman's rank correlation coefficient;Spearman's rank correlation coefficient is a correlation coefficient which is a nonparametric measure of statistical dependence between two ranked variables. It assesses how well the relationship between two variables can be described using a monotonic function. If there are no repeated data values, a perfect Spearman correlation of +1 or −1 occurs when each of the variables is a perfect monotone function of the other. Spearman's coefficient may be used when the conditions for computing Pearson's correlation are not met (e.g linearity, normality of the 2 continuous variables) but may require a ranking transformation of the variables
generically dependent continuant;contrast weight;a contrast weight is a coefficient which multiplies a group mean, part of a linear combinaison defining a constrast as a weighted sum of group means, giving a 'weight' to a specific group mean hence the name.

process;Partial Least Square regression;Partial least squares regression (PLS regression) is a data transformation that bears some relation to principal components regression. instead of finding hyperplanes of maximum variance between the response and independent variables, it finds a linear regression model by projecting the predicted variables and the observable variables to a new space. Because both the X and Y data are projected to new spaces, the PLS family of methods are known as bilinear factor models. Partial least squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) is a variant used when the Y is categorical. PLS is used to find the fundamental relations between two matrices (X and Y), i.e. a latent variable approach to modeling the covariance structures in these two spaces. A PLS model will try to find the multidimensional direction in the X space that explains the maximum multidimensional variance direction in the Y space. PLS regression is particularly suited when the matrix of predictors has more variables than observations, and when there is multicollinearity among X values. By contrast, standard regression will fail in these cases (unless it is regularized). Partial least squares was introduced by the Swedish statistician Herman O. A. Wold, who then developed it with his son, Svante Wold. An alternative term for PLS (and more correct according to Svante Wold[1]) is projection to latent structures, but the term partial least squares is still dominant in many areas. Although the original applications were in the social sciences, PLS regression is today most widely used in chemometrics and related areas. It is also used in bioinformatics, sensometrics, neuroscience and anthropology.

generically dependent continuant;credible interval;In Bayesian statistics context, a credible interval is an interval of a posterior distribution which is such that the density at any point inside the interval is greater than the density at any point outside and that the area under the curve for that interval is equal to a prespecified probability level. For any probability level there is generally only one such interval, which is also often known as the highest posterior density region. Unlike the usual confidence interval associated with frequentist inference, here the intervals specify the range within which parameters lie with a certain probability. The Bayesian counterparts of the confidence interval used in Frequentists Statistics.
process;SIMPLS;A novel algorithm for partial least squares (PLS) regression, SIMPLS, is proposed which calculates the PLS factors directly as linear combinations of the original variables. The PLS factors are determined such as to maximize a covariance criterion, while obeying certain orthogonality and normalization restrictions. This approach follows that of other traditional multivariate methods. The construction of deflated data matrices as in the nonlinear iterative partial least squares (NIPALS)-PLS algorithm is avoided. For univariate y SIMPLS is equivalent to PLS1 and closely related to existing bidiagonalization algorithms. This follows from an analysis of PLS1 regression in terms of Krylov sequences. For multivariate Y there is a slight difference between the SIMPLS approach and NIPALS-PLS2. In practice the SIMPLS algorithm appears to be fast and easy to interpret as it does not involve a breakdown of the data sets. The acronym SIMPLS comes from 'straightforward implementation of a statistically inspired modification of the PLS method'

generically dependent continuant;linear mixed model;A lnear mixed model is a mixed model containing both fixed effects and random effects and in which factors and covariates are assumed to have a linear relationship to the dependent variable. These models are useful in a wide variety of disciplines in the physical, biological and social sciences. They are particularly useful in settings where repeated measurements are made on the same statistical units (longitudinal study), or where measurements are made on clusters of related statistical units. Because of their advantage in dealing with missing values, mixed effects models are often preferred over more traditional approaches such as repeated measures ANOVA. Fixed-effects factors are generally considered to be the variables whose values of interest are all represented in the data file. Random-effects factors are variables whose values correspond to unwanted variation. They are useful when trying to understand variability in the dependent variable which was not anticipated and exceeds what was expected. Linear mixed models also allow to specify specific interactions between factors, and allow the evaluation of the various linear effect that a particular combination of factor levels may have on a response variable. Finally, linear mixed models allow to specify variance components in order to describe the relation between various random effects levels.

It is used to provide an estimation of the effect size between two treatments when the predictor (independent variable) is categorical and the response(dependent) variable is continuous. A standardized mean difference is a statistic that is a difference between two means, divided by a statistical measure of dispersion. The term Standardized Mean Difference is a description of the concept without an explicit type of statistical measure of dispersion. If the statistical measure of dispersion is specified, then a type (child term) of Standardized Mean Difference is preferred.

process;Haybittle-Peto boundary analysis;The Haybittle–Peto boundary analysis is an interim analysis where a rule for deciding when to stop a clinical trial prematurely is defined. It is named for John Haybittle and Richard Peto. The Haybittle–Peto boundary is one such stopping rule, and it states that if an interim analysis shows a probability of equal to, or less than 0.001 that a difference as extreme or more between the treatments is found, given that the null hypothesis is true, then the trial should be stopped early. The final analysis is still evaluated at the normal level of significance (usually 0.05).[3][4] The main advantage of the Haybittle–Peto boundary is that the same threshold is used at every interim analysis, unlike the O'Brien–Fleming boundary, which changes at every analysis. Also, using the Haybittle–Peto boundary means that the final analysis is performed using a 0.05 level of significance as normal, which makes it easier for investigators and readers to understand. The main argument against the Haybittle–Peto boundary is that some investigators believe that the Haybittle–Peto boundary is too conservative and makes it too difficult to stop a trial. As all frequentist methods of the same type, it focuses on controlling the type I error rate as the repeated hypothesis testing of accumulating data increases the type I error rate of a clinical trial.

The Wald statistic is tested against the Chi-square distribution in the Wald test.
generically dependent continuant;false negative rate;the false negative rate is a data item which denotes the proportion of missed detection of elements known to be meeting the detection criteria
process;Pocock boundary analysis;The Pocock boundary analysis gives a p-value threshold for each interim analysis which guides the data monitoring committee on whether to stop the trial. The boundary used depends on the number of interim analyses. The Pocock boundary is simple to use in that the p-value threshold is the same at each interim analysis. The disadvantages are that the number of interim analyses must be fixed at the start and it is not possible under this scheme to add analyses after the trial has started. Another disadvantage is that investigators and readers frequently do not understand how the p-values are reported: for example, if there are five interim analyses planned, but the trial is stopped after the third interim analysis because the p-value was 0.01, then the overall p-value for the trial is still reported as <0.05 and not as 0.01. As all frequentist methods of the same type, it focuses on controlling the type I error rate as the repeated hypothesis testing of accumulating data increases the type I error rate of a clinical trial.
realizable entity;completely randomized design;a completely randomized design is a type of design of experiment where the observation unit receive treatments (independent variable level) entirely at random.

Then only, the members of each block are then randomly assigned to different treatment groups

generically dependent continuant;quantile;a quantile is a data item which corresponds to specific elements x in the range of a variate X. the k-th n-tile P k is that value of x, say x k, which corresponds to a cumulative frequency of Nk/n (Kenney and Keeping 1962). If n=4, the quantity is called a quartile, and if n=100, it is called a percentile.

generically dependent continuant;goodness of fit hypothesis;goodness of fit hypothesis is a null hypothesis stating that the distribution computed from the sample population fits a theoretical distribution or that a dataset can be correctly explained by a model
process;ANCOVA;ANCOVA or analysis of covariance is a data transformation which evaluates if population means of a dependent variable are equal across levels of a categorical independent variables while controlling for the effects of other continuous variable s, known as covariates. Therefore, when performing ANCOVA, we are adjusting the dependent variable means to what they would be if all groups were equal on the covariates. It augments the ANOVA model with one or more additional quantitative variables, called covariates, which are related to the response variable. The covariates are included to reduce the variance in the error terms and provide more precise measurement of the treatment effects. ANCOVA is used to test the main and interaction effects of the factors, while controlling for the effects of the covariate
generically dependent continuant;skewness;Skewness is a data item indicating of the degree of asymmetry of a distribution.
generically dependent continuant;mixed effect model;A mixed model is a statistical model containing both fixed effects and random effects. These models are useful in a wide variety of disciplines in the physical, biological and social sciences. They are particularly useful in settings where repeated measurements are made on the same statistical units (longitudinal study), or where measurements are made on clusters of related statistical units. Because of their advantage in dealing with missing values, mixed effects models are often preferred over more traditional approaches such as repeated measures ANOVA.
generically dependent continuant;continuous probability distribution;a continuous probability distribution is a probability distribution which is defined by a probability density function
generically dependent continuant;average log signal intensity;average log signal intensity is a data time which corresponds to the sum of 2 distinct logarithm base 2 transformed signal intensity, each corresponding to a distinct condition of signal acquisition, divided by 2.
generically dependent continuant;Cleveland dot plot;Cleveland dot plot is a dot plot which plots points that each belong to one of several categories. They are an alternative to bar charts or pie charts, and look somewhat like a horizontal bar chart where the bars are replaced by a dots at the values associated with each category. Compared to (vertical) bar charts and pie charts, Cleveland argues that dot plots allow more accurate interpretation of the graph by readers by making the labels easier to read, reducing non-data ink (or graph clutter) and supporting table look-up.which
process;Tukey HSD for Post-Hoc Analysis;Tukey Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) test is a statistical test used following an ANOVA test yielding a statistically significant p-value in order to determine which means are different, to a given level of significance. The Tukey HSD test relies on the q-distribution. The procedure is conservative, meaning that if sample sizes (the sizes of different study groups) are equal, the risk of a Type I error is exactly α, and if sample sizes are unequal it’s less than α.

generically dependent continuant;Lineweaver-Burk plot;Lineweaver-Burk plot is a graph which is the graphical representation of the Lineweaver–Burk equation of enzyme kinetics, described by Hans Lineweaver and Dean Burk in 1934. The plot provides a useful graphical method for analysis of the Michaelis–Menten equation. It was widely used to determine important terms in enzymology and enzyme kinetics as the x-intercept of the graph represents −1/Km and the y-intercept of such a graph is equivalent to the inverse of Vmax

generically dependent continuant;absence of between group difference hypothesis;It is a null hypothesis stating that there are no differences observed between group of subjects.
generically dependent continuant;odds ratio;Odds ratio is a ratio that measures effect size, that is the strength of association between 2 dichotomous variables, one describing an exposure and one describing an outcome. It represents the odds that an outcome will occur given a particular exposure, compared to the odds of the outcome occurring in the absence of that exposure ( the probability of the event occuring divided by the probability of an event not occurring). The odds ratio is a ratio of describing the strength of association or non-independence between two binary data values by forming the ratio of the odds for the first group and the odds for the second group. Odds ratio are used when one wants to compare the odds of something occurring to two different groups.

In statistics, the number of degrees of freedom ν is equal to N-1 in the case of the direct measurement of a quantity estimated by the arithmetic mean of N independent observations.
process;Barlett's test;Bartlett's test (see Snedecor and Cochran, 1989) is used to test if k samples are from populations with equal variances. Equal variances across samples is called homoscedasticity or homogeneity of variances. Some statistical tests, for example the analysis of variance, assume that variances are equal across groups or samples. The Bartlett test can be used to verify that assumption. Bartlett's test is sensitive to departures from normality. That is, if the samples come from non-normal distributions, then Bartlett's test may simply be testing for non-normality. Levene's test and the Brown–Forsythe test are alternatives to the Bartlett test that are less sensitive to departures from normality.
process;Levene's test;Levene's test is a null hypothesis statistical test which evaluates the null hypothesis of equality of variance in several populations.
process;Mauchly's test for sphericity;the Mauchly's test for sphericity is a statistical test which evaluates if the variance of the differences between all combinations of the groups are equal, a property known as 'sphericity' in the context of repeated measures. It is used for instance prior to repeated measure ANOVA. The test works by assessing if a Wishart-distributed covariance matrix (or transformation thereof) is proportional to a given matrix.

process;Cochran-Mantel-Haenzel test for repeated tests of independence;Cochran-Mantel-Haenzel test for repeated tests of independence is a statitiscal test which allows the comparison of two groups on a dichotomous/categorical response. It is used when the effect of the explanatory variable on the response variable is influenced by covariates that can be controlled. It is often used in observational studies where random assignment of subjects to different treatments cannot be controlled, but influencing covariates can. The null hypothesis is that the two nominal variables that are tested within each repetition are independent of each other. So there are 3 variables to consider: two categorical variables to be tested for independence of each other, and the third variable identifies the repeats.

process;Yate's corrected Chi-Squared test;Yate's corrected Chi-Squared test is a statistical test which is used to test the association/linkage/independence of 2 dichotomous variables while introducing a correction for using the continous Chi-squared distribution for the test. To reduce the error in approximation, Frank Yates, an English statistician, suggested a correction for continuity that adjusts the formula for Pearson's chi-squared test by subtracting 0.5 from the difference between each observed value and its expected value in a 2 × 2 contingency table. This reduces the chi-squared value obtained and thus increases its p-value.
