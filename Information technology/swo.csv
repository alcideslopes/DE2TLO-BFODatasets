generically dependent continuant;50-50 MANOVA algorithm;Classical multivariate analysis-of-variance tests perform poorly in cases with several highly correlated responses and the tests collapse when the number of responses exceeds the number of observations. This paper presents a new method which handles this problem. The dimensionality of the data is reduced by using principal component decompositions and the final tests are still based on the classical test statistics and their distributions. The methodology is illustrated with an example from the production of sausages with responses from near infrared reflectance spectroscopy. A closely related method for testing relationships in uniresponse regression with collinear explanatory variables is also presented. The new test, which is called the 50-50 F-test, uses the first k components to calculate SSMODEL. The next d components are not involved in SSERROR and they are called buffer components.

generically dependent continuant;GlobalAncova;GlobalAncova approach: After appropriate normalisation, gene-expression-data appear rather symmetrical and outliers are no real problem, so least squares should be rather robust. ANCOVA with interaction yields saturated data modelling e.g. different means per group and gene. Covariate adjustment can help to correct for possible selection bias. Variance homogeneity and uncorrelated residuals cannot be expected. Application of ordinary least squares gives unbiased, but no longer optimal estimates (Gauss-Markov-Aitken). Therefore, using the classical F-test is inappropriate, due to correlation. The test statistic however mirrors deviations from the null hypothesis. In combination with a permutation approach, empirical significance levels can be approximated. Alternatively, an approximation yields asymptotic p-values.
