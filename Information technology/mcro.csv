generically dependent continuant;Out of Scope Use Case Section Information;"Here, the model card should highlight technology that the model might easily be confused with, or related contexts that users could try to apply the model to. This section may provide an opportunity to recommend a related or similar model that was designed to better meet that particular need, where possible. This section is inspired by warning labels on food and toys, and similar disclaimers presented in electronic datasheets." Content that is a type of use case information but specific to use cases that are out of scope of the intended use case.

generically dependent continuant;License Information Section;Section for information about the licensing for the machine learning model.
generically dependent continuant;Use Case Information Section;The content here involves information about intential uses of the model. "This section should allow readers to quickly grasp what the model should and should not be used for, and why it was created. It can also help frame the statistical analysis presented in the rest of the card, including a short description of the user(s), use-case(s), and context(s) for which the model was originally developed."

generically dependent continuant;Graphic Collection Section;A section describing the set of graphics accompanying the model card's dataset
generically dependent continuant;Trade-off Information Section;Content involving known trade-offs for the use of the model. Trade offs might include performance or technical or ethical. "This section should list additional concerns that were not covered in the previous sections. For example, did the results suggest any further testing? Were there any relevant groups that were not represented in the evaluation dataset? Are there additional recommendations for model use? What are the ideal characteristics of an evaluation dataset for this model?"
generically dependent continuant;Format Information Section;This content summarizes the input and output data format for the model.
generically dependent continuant;Synthetic Evaluation Data Information Section;The section is devoted in descrbing the synthetic evaluation datasets used for a machine learning model. Synthetic evaluation datasets are a type of evaluation dataset. "It is often difficult to find datasets that represent populations outside of the initial domain used in training. In some of these situations, synthetically generated datasets may provide representation for use cases that would otherwise go unevaluated" (Mitchell et al., 2019). This section should described the aforementioned.
generically dependent continuant;False Positive Rate Information Section;This content describes the information pertaining to the model's false postive rate. "A false positive error, or false positive, is a result that indicates a given condition exists when it does not. For example, a pregnancy test which indicates a woman is pregnant when she is not, or the conviction of an innocent person. A false positive error is a type I error where the test is checking a single condition, and wrongly gives an affirmative (positive) decision."
generically dependent continuant;Sensitive Data Information Section;Information relating to sensitive datasets that contain info like personal information that was used to develop the machine learning model
generically dependent continuant;False Ommission Rate Section Information;This section describes information relating to false ommision rate of the performance of the machine learning model. FOR is the probability that the true value is positive.
generically dependent continuant;Risk Information Section;Content information relating to potential uncertainity about utilizing the model
generically dependent continuant;False Discovery Rate Information Section;The section describes information about the false discovery rate of the machine learning model. "The false discovery rate (FDR) is a method of conceptualizing the rate of type I errors in null hypothesis testing when conducting multiple comparisons. FDR-controlling procedures are designed to control the FDR, which is the expected proportion of "discoveries" (rejected null hypotheses) that are false (incorrect rejections of the null)". quivalently, the FDR is the expected ratio of the number of false positive classifications (false discoveries) to the total number of positive classifications (rejections of the null). The total number of rejections of the null include both the number of false positives (FP) and true positives (TP). Simply put, FDR = FP / (FP + TP). FDR-controlling procedures provide less stringent control of Type I errors compared to familywise error rate (FWER) controlling procedures (such as the Bonferroni correction), which control the probability of at least one Type I error. Thus, FDR-controlling procedures have greater power, at the cost of increased numbers of Type I errors."
