process;correlation statistical analysis;A measure of the linear association between two variables that are measured on ordinal, interval or ratio scales
disposition;proprietary uncertainty;Proprietary uncertainty occurs due to the fact that information and knowledge about an issue are not uniformly shared among all those who could potentially use it. That is, some people or groups have information that others don't and may assert ownership or control over it. "Proprietary uncertainty becomes most salient when it is necessary to reconcile the general needs for safety, health, and environment protection with more sectorial needs pertaining, for instance, to industrial production and process, or to licensing and control procedures" (De Marchi, 1994). De Marchi notes that 'whistle blowing' is another source of proprietary uncertainty in that there is a need for protection of those who act in sharing information for the public good. Proprietary uncertainty would typically be high when knowledge plays a key role in assessment, but is not widely shared among participants. An example of such would be the case of external safety of military nuclear production facilities.
process;intent-to-treat analysis;An inferential statistical data analysis that includes all randomized patients in the groups to which they were randomly assigned. The intent-to-treat analysis is based on the initial treatment assignment and not on the treatment eventually received. ITT analysis includes every subject who is randomized according to randomized treatment assignment. It ignores noncompliance, protocol deviations, withdrawal, and anything that happens after randomization.
disposition;situational uncertainty;Situational uncertainty relates to "the predicament of the person responsible for a crisis, either in the phase of preparation and planning, or of actual emergency. It refers to individual behaviours or personal interventions in crisis situations" (De Marchi, 1994) and as such represents a form of integration over the other six types of uncertainty. That is, it tends to combine the uncertainties one has to face in a given situation or on a particular issue. High situational uncertainty would be characterized by situations where individual decisions play a substantial role and there is uncertainty about the nature of those decisions.

The distributions considered under the null hypothesis are continuous distributions but are otherwise unrestricted.
disposition;psychological uncertainty;A belief is psychologically certain when the subject who has it is supremely convinced of its truth. Certainty in this sense is similar to incorrigibility, which is the property a belief has of being such that the subject is incapable of giving it up. But psychological certainty is not the same thing as incorrigibility. A belief can be certain in this sense without being incorrigible. this may happen, for example, when the subject receives a very compelling bit of counterevidence to the (previously) certain belief and gives it up for that reason. Moreover, a belief can be incorrigible without being psychologically certain. For example, a mother may be incapable of giving up the belief that her son did not commit a gruesome murder, and yet, compatible with that inextinguishable belief, she may be tortured by doubt.

Uncertainty about system data is generated by a lack of knowledge of the properties (including both the deterministic and the stochastic properties) of the underlying system and deficiencies in the description of the variability that can be an inherent feature of some of the phenomena under observation.
generically dependent continuant;mixed model;A statistical model containing both fixed effects and random effects, that is mixed effects.
process;non-parametric test;A statistical hypothesis test that is not based on any parameterized family of probability distributions.
disposition;moral uncertainty;Moral uncertainty stems from the underlying moral issues related to action and inaction in any given case. De Marchi notes that, though similar to legal responsibility, moral guilt may occur absent legal responsibility when negative consequences might have been limited by the dissemination of prior information or more effective management for example. "Moral uncertainty is linked to the ethical tradition of a given country be it or not enacted in legislation (juridical and societal norms, shared moral values, mores), as well as the psychological characteristics of persons in charge, their social status and professional roles" (De Marchi, 1994). Moral uncertainty would typically be high when moral and ethical dimensions of an issue are central and participants have a range of understandings of the moral imperatives at stake.
process;probability density function;A data transformation that represents a mathematical function describing the relative likelihood of a continuous random variable to take on a value.
disposition;societal uncertainty;Communities from one region to another may differ in the set of norms, values, and manner of relating characteristic of their societies. This in turn can result in differences in approach to decision making and assessment. Some salient characteristics of these differences will be different views about the role of consensus versus conflict, on locating responsibility between individuals and larger groups, on views about the legitimacy and role of social and private institutions, and on attitudes to authority and expertise. From De Marchi (1994). Societal uncertainty would typically be high when decisions involve substantial collaboration among groups characterized by divergent decision making styles.

Institutional uncertainty stems from the "diverse cultures and traditions, divergent missions and values, different structures, and work styles among personnel of different agencies" (De Marchi, 1994). High institutional uncertainty can hinder collaboration or understanding among agencies, and can make the actions of institutions difficult to predict.
generically dependent continuant;likelihood ratio;A quantitative confidence value that expresses how many times more likely the data are under one model than the other.
