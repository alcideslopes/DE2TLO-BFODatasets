process;research mission;Coordinated tasks and operations undertaken to meet a set of specific scientific or technical objectives, within clearly delineated time and location constraints.
generically dependent continuant;scientific results;A type of document, physical or digital, comprised of data and/or analytical assessment related to a scientific protocol.
generically dependent continuant;dataset file;A set of related data (either written or electronic) and is a part of a dataset
process;beyond low earth orbit space flight;Activity carried out by crewed or robotic vehicles outside the Earth's inner radiation belt.
material entity;subject;An entity of interest, either biological or otherwise. EXAMPLE(S): A human being who might be of interest because they are on a study, a sheep who might have experienced an adverse event, or a pacemaker that failed. An entity, either biologic or otherwise, of interest in an investigation. [Definition Source: NCI]
process;low earth orbit space flight;Activity carried out by crewed or robotic vehicles outside the Earth's atmosphere but inside the Earth's inner radiation belt.
material entity;hardware;A physical, manufactured or otherwise processed object that is used in a scientific investigation or clinical activity.
process;suborbital space flight;A flight in which a vehicle, launched from either the ground or from an aircraft, has a trajectory which carries it above a substantial part of the atmosphere but does not reach orbit. The occupants and/or contents experience a period (typically minutes) of microgravity by virtue of being in free fall.
material entity;component;An item of hardware that is a part of another item of hardware.
process;parabolic flight;A flight within the atmosphere of the Earth or another body where an aircraft describes a series of parabolic arcs lasting on the order of tens of seconds to simulate microgravity
material entity;personnel;Persons employed in any field.
quality;research area;Indicates the scientific area addressed by the study. This clas is maintained by NASA Life Sciences Data Archive.

material entity;beyond low earth orbit spacecraft;A vehicle operating or capable of operating in an extraterrestrial environment beyond the Earth's radiation belts.
material entity;biospecimen;Any material sample taken from a biological entity for testing, diagnostic, propagation, treatment or research purposes, including a sample obtained from a living organism or taken from the biological object after halting of all its life functions. Biospecimen can contain one or more components including but not limited to cellular molecules, cells, tissues, organs, body fluids, embryos, and body excretory products
process;space flight;Activity carried out by crewed or robotic vehicles outside the Earth's atmmosphere.
material entity;spacecraft;Devices, manned and unmanned, which are designed to be placed into an orbit about the Earth or into a trajectory to another celestial body.
material entity;suborbital space flight vehicle;A vehicle which traverses or is capable of traversing the boundary between the atmosphere and space without reaching low earth orbit.
material entity;low earth orbit spacecraft;A vehicle operating or capable of operating in an extraterrestrial environment between the Earth's atmosphere and the innermost Earth radiation belt
