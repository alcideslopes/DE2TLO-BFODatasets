generically dependent continuant;observation design;observation design is a study design in which subjects are monitored in the absence of any active intervention by experimentalists.
material entity;vacuum degasser;A degassing system used for degassing solvents in liquid chromatography. Dissolved gasses, usually nitrogen and oxygen from the air, tend to be evolved in the mobile phase as the pressure is reduced when the mobile phase leaves the liquid chromatography column and enters the detector. Gasses in the mobile phase in the detector can produce completely unacceptable noise and, thus, must be removed. The dissolved gasses were originally removed under vacuum but, unfortunately, are soon replaced if the solvent is left in contact with air at atmospheric pressure. For this reason degassing is now usually carried out by bubbling helium through the mobile phase reservoirs. Secondly, vacuum is used in the thermionic detector. This consists of a device, very similar in design to the thermionic valve which is attached to a vacuum and a small quantity of the eluent from a gas chromatography column allowed to bleed through it. Helium is used as the carrier gas. The presence of solute vapor causes the thermionic current to fall. This type of detector tends to become contaminated rather readily.

material entity;nitrogen phosphorous detector;The nitrogen phosphorus detector (NPD) (sometimes called the thermionic detector) is a very sensitive, specific detector the design of which, is based on the FID. Physically the sensor appears to be very similar to the FID but, in fact, operates on an entirely different principle. The nitrogen phosphorous detector (sometimes called the thermionic detector) is a very sensitive but specific detector that responds almost exclusively to nitrogen and phosphorous compounds. It is based on the flame ionization detector but differs in that it contains a rubidium or cesium silicate (glass) bead situated in a heater coil, a little distance from the hydrogen flame. If the detector is to respond to both nitrogen and phosphorous then the hydrogen flow should be minimal so that the gas does not ignite at the jet. If the detector is to respond to phosphorous only, a large flow of hydrogen is used which is burnt at the jet. The heated bead emits electrons by thermionic emission. These electrons are collected under a potential of a few volts by an appropriately placed anode, and provides a background current. When a solute containing nitrogen or phosphorous is eluted from the column, the partially combusted nitrogen and phosphorous materials are adsorbed on the surface of the bead. The adsorbed material reduces the work function of the surface and, as consequence, the emission of electrons is increased which raises the current collected at the electrode. The sensitivity of the detector to phosphorous is about 10-12 gram per ml and for nitrogen about 10-11 gram per ml at a signal to nose ratio of 2. The alkali bead as a finite life and needs regular replacement.

material entity;photoionization detector;The selective determination of aromatic hydrocarbons or organo-heteroatom species is the job of the photoionization detector (PID). This device uses ultraviolet light as a means of ionizing an analyte exiting from a GC column. The ions produced by this process are collected by electrodes. The current generated is therefore a measure of the analyte concentration. f the amount of ionization is reproducible for a given compound, pressure, and light source then the current collected at the PID's reaction cell electrodes is reproducibly proportional to the amount of that compound entering the cell. The reason why the compounds that are routinely analyzed are either aromatic hydrocarbons or heteroatom containing compounds (like organosulfur or organophosphorus species) is because these species have ionization potentials (IP) that are within reach of commercially available UV lamps. The available lamp energies range from 8.3 to 11.7 ev, that is, lambda max ranging from 150 nm to 106 nm. Although most PIDs have only one lamp, lamps in the PID are exchanged depending on the compound selectivity required in the analysis.

material entity;liquid chromatography valve;A sample valve that must be able to sustain pressures up to 10,000 p.s.i., although it is most likely to operate on a continuous basis, at pressures of 3,000 p.s.i. or less. The higher the operating pressure the tighter the valve seating surfaces must be forced together to eliminate any leak. It follows that any abrasive material, however fine, that passes into the valve can cause the valve seating to become scored each time it is rotated which will ultimately lead to leaks. This will cause the sample size to vary between samples and eventually affect the accuracy of the analysis. It follows that any solid material must be carefully removed from any sample before filling the valve. The sample volume of an internal loop valve is situated in the connecting slot of the valve rotor and can be used only for relatively small sample volumes. Internal sample loop valves provide samples with volumes ranging from 0.1 ml to about 0.5 ml. Valve operation is shown in figure 6. The left-hand side diagram shows the load position. The sample occupies the rotor slot and has been filled by passing the sample from an appropriate syringe through the rotor slot to waste. While loading the sample, the mobile phase supply is passed through the valve directly to the column. To place the sample onto the column, the valve is then rotated and the valve slot containing the sample is now placed between the solvent supply and the column. As a result, the sample is passed into the column by the flow of solvent.

The fractions can be collected on a basis of time either at regular intervals or a specific times to collect specific peaks. Alternatively the fractions can be collected by monitoring the detector output and when a peak starts to elute the fraction collector is activated and the peak collected in a specific vial. When the peak returns to base line the column eluate is then directed to waste until the next peak starts eluting. Fraction collectors are in common use with most liquid chromatographs. They are used to collect samples for further purification, subsequent examination by spectroscopic techniques or for biological or organoleptic testing.

Of the K subsamples, a single subsample is retained as the validation data for testing the model, and the remaining K - 1 subsamples are used as training data. The cross-validation process is then repeated K times (the folds), with each of the K subsamples used exactly once as the validation data. The K results from the folds then can be averaged (or otherwise combined) to produce a single estimation. The advantage of this method over repeated random sub-sampling is that all observations are used for both training and validation, and each observation is used for validation exactly once. 10-fold cross-validation is commonly used

This is directly related to carrier gas flow rate, temperature and column packing and dimensions. The area under each peak is proportional to the concentration of the component of the sample. The area of the peaks inscribed on the chart recorder can be determined by multiplying the height of the peak in mm, by the width of the peak in mm at 1/2 the peak height. The calibration curves for use with the chart recorder are therefore peak area plotted against concentration.

material entity;DNA microarray;A DNA-microarray is a microarray that is used as a physical 2D immobilisation matrix for DNA sequences. DNA microarray-bound DNA fragments are used as targets for a hybridising probed sample.
material entity;microarray;A processed material that is made to be used in an analyte assay. It consists of a physical immobilisation matrix in which substances that bind the analyte are placed in regular spatial position.
material entity;courier organization;An organization that delivers messages, packages, and mail.
generically dependent continuant;courier tracking number;A centrally registered identifier symbol assigned by a courier organization in order to track the delivery of an item.
material entity;power supply;A power supply is an device or part of a device that permits the required application of a defined electrical charge to an instrument. The power supply may permit the defined application of a given amount of current for a defined length of time.
material entity;gel tank;A device which holds a gel and running buffers to allow electrophoresis to be performed. A gel tank has the function to contain and to control the contained environment and transfer energy from an energy supply through the running buffers to the gel matrix and the material with charged molecules in an electric field across a porous matrix or medium with the objective to separate the charged molecules.
material entity;multispectral imaging flow cytometer;A multispectral imaging flow cytometer is an instrument which combines quantitative image analysis and flow cytometry in a single platform. It measures the amount, location and movement of molecules on, in, or between cells, and the location and co-localization of multiple markers on or in cells. It can also quantitate morphologically distinct cell subpopulations.
material entity;fluorometer;A fluorometer is an instrument for the detection and measurement of parameters of fluoresence, which in turn are used to identify the presence and amount of specific molecules in the sample.
