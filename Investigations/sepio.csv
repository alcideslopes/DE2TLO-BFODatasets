entity;proposition;An abstract entity representing the sharable meaning of what is expressed in a particular assertion.
generically dependent continuant;evidence direction;A data item that indicates an agent's assessment of whether an evidence line supports or disputes a target proposition (or represents inconclusive evidence that is not sufficient for either).
