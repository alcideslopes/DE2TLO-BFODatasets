specifically dependent continuant;invisible to unaided eye;A physical object quality that is inhered in a material entity that is too small to be viewed by the unaided eye.
process;population process;A process that has as primary participant a population. Includes processes such as population growth, extinction, evolution, selection, and adaptation. Population processes may depend on the processes of individual organisms {e.g., population growth reflects the cumulative multicellular organism reproduction (GO:0032504) and death (GO:0016265) of all individuals in a population}, but cannot be described for an individual organism. Some of these processes (e.g., evolution, extinction) can also occur at the species level, so PCO distinguishes between, for example, population extinction and species extinction.

Community species diversity can be calculated in different ways, but consists of two components: species richness and species evenness.

process;population growth;A process that leads to a change in the number of individuals (positive or negative) in a population.
process;logistic population growth;A population process that leads to an increase in the numbers of individuals in a population following a logistic (S-shaped) curve. Generally occurs when the population has a carrying capacity in a particular habitat.
