The acid gives filmjölk a sour taste and causes proteins in the milk, mainly casein, to coagulate, thus thickening the final product. The bacteria also produce a limited amount of diacetyl, which gives filmjölk its characteristic taste. Filmjölk is similar to cultured buttermilk, kefir, or yoghurt in consistency, but fermented by different bacteria and thus has a slightly different taste.

Ferns are not as important economically as seed plants but have considerable importance in some societies. Some ferns are used for food, including the fiddleheads of *Pteridium aquilinum* (bracken), *Matteuccia struthiopteris* (ostrich fern), and *Osmundastrum cinnamomeum* (cinnamon fern).

material entity;eurocode 2 food classification;
material entity;Codex Alimentarius classification of food and feed commodities;Codex Alimentarius, Volume 2 - 1993, Section 2: Pesticide Residues in Food. The Codex Classification of food and animal feed commodities moving in trade and the description of the various items and groups of food and animal feedstuffs included in the present document have been developed by the Codex Committee on Pesticide Residues. It was first adopted by the 18th Session of the Codex Alimentarius Commission, (1989). The Codex Classification includes food commodities and animal feedstuffs for which Codex maximum residue limits will not necessarily be established. The Classification is intended to be as complete a listing of food commodities in trade as possible, classified into groups on the basis of the commodity's similar potential for pesticide residues. The Classification may also be appropriate for other purposes such as setting maximum levels for other types of residues or for other contaminants in food. The Codex Classification should be consulted in order to obtain a precise description of the food or animal feed commodities and, especially, in cases where Codex maximum residue limits have been set for groups of food and groups of animal feedstuffs. The Codex Classification is intended to promote harmonization of the terms used to describe commodities which are subject to maximum residue limits and of the approach to grouping commodities with similar potential for residue for which a common group maximum residue limit can be set.

Some types of the primary feed commodities are grown and used exclusively for animal feeding purposes, e.g. alfalfa vetch and maize forage. Other types are derived from crops of which the edible parts are used directly or after processing as food, whereas the "waste" parts of these crops are generally used for feeding purposes, e.g. cereal straws, pea vines (fresh = green), pea hay, maize fodder, sugar beet tops or -leaves.
material entity;02 vegetables (ccpr);Vegetables are foods derived from many different kinds of plants mostly annual and usually cultivated, commonly known by custom and tradition as "vegetables". In several countries, some of these commodities grown on large areas are distinguished as "field crops" or arable crops e.g. sugar beet. For the sake of convenience in this guide such crops are classified under Type 2 Vegetables. Exposure to pesticides is dependent on the particular part of the plant used for food and the growing practices. Vegetables may be consumed in whole or in part and in the form of fresh, dried or processed foods.

material entity;european food groups (efg);The European Food Groups (EFG) classification system was developed, as a project of COST Action 99/Eurofoods, in an attempt to evaluate the level of food description and classification that would permit international comparisons of the results of available food consumption and food availability surveys. In order to formulate the EFG system, several classification schemes used for recording food intake at the international and national classification schemes were compared: International - FAO Food Balance Sheet, WHO GEMS/FOODS regional diets, DAFNE classification system for Household Budget Survey (HBS) data, and Eurocode 2 core classification (levels 1 and 2). National - French National Food Consumption Survey (1999), Dutch National Food Consumption Survey (1998), and British National Food Survey. In the process of comparing food intake data from various European countries, it became evident that such comparisons are feasible only when results are expressed at the raw ingredient level. Since the DAFNE classification system groups food items at the raw level, it was one of the international classification schemes used to create the EFG food grouping system.

Crustaceans are prepared for wholesale or retail distribution at a "raw" stage, often still alive, "raw" and deep-frozen or cooked directly after catching and deep-frozen. Shrimps or prawns may also be parboiled and thereafter deep-frozen. Although the cooked or parboiled crustaceans should be regarded as processed foods, the animals of this group are primarily classified in the Chapter on Primary food commodities, Type 8: Aquatic animal products, since several crustaceans are also-marketed in a "raw" form, i.e. not exposed to temperatures sufficiently high to coagulate the protein at the surface. A short reference to processed Crustaceans is given in Type 17: Derived edible products of animal origin, Group 084 Crustaceans, processed. The entire commodity except the shell may be consumed: the "raw" commodities, in general, after cooking. In some countries, species such as the Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus) are included in the commodity "Prawns" with some qualifying designation, such as Dublin Bay Prawn or Prawn of Bantry Bay (both Ireland).The Codex Stan. 92-1981 on Quick Frozen Shrimps and Prawns does not prevent this practice, provided that the designation on the label ensures that the consumer will not be misled. There is no clear-cut distinction between Shrimps and Prawns. In several countries the commodity name-Shrimps is used for the small species whereas the slightly larger ones are called Prawns. However, a species marked in certain regions of the world as "Prawn" may be called in the local English language in other areas a shrimp and visa versa, e.g., Pandalus borcalis is called Northern prawn or Deepwater prawn in the United Kingdom and the same species is named Pink shrimp in Canada.

material entity;sillago-whiting family;The *Sillaginidae*, commonly known as the smelt-whitings, whitings, sillaginids, sand borers and sand-smelts, are a family of benthic coastal marine fishes in the order Perciformes. The smelt-whitings inhabit a wide region covering much of the Indo-Pacific, from the west coast of Africa east to Japan and south to Australia. The family comprises only three genera and thirty one species, of which a number are dubious, with the last major revision of the family in 1992 unable to confirm the validity of a number of species. They are elongate, slightly compressed fish often light brown to silver in colour with a variety of markings and patterns on their upper body. The Sillaginidae are not related to a number of fishes commonly called 'whiting' in the Northern Hemisphere, including the fish originally called whiting, *Merlangius merlangus*.
material entity;blood orange plant;The blood orange is a variety of orange (*Citrus sinensis*) with crimson, almost-blood-colored flesh. The fruit is smaller than an average orange. its skin is usually pitted, but can be smooth. The distinctive dark flesh color is due to the presence of anthocyanins, a family of pigments common to many flowers and fruit, but uncommon in citrus fruits. The flesh develops its characteristic maroon color when the fruit develops with low temperatures during the night. Sometimes there is dark coloring on the exterior of the rind as well, depending on the variety of blood orange. The skin can also be more tough and harder to peel than other oranges. While all oranges are likely of hybrid origin between the pomelo and the tangerine, blood oranges originated as a mutation of the sweet orange. Within Europe, the Arancia Rossa di Sicilia (Red Orange of Sicily) has Protected Geographical Status.
material entity;yellow onion plant;The brown onion or yellow onion (*Allium cepa *L.) is a variety of dry onion with a strong flavour.

Some sources state that Ratites are synonymous with *Struthioiniformes*, while other sources state that Ratites are the same group, only that the order *Struthioniformes* contains only the Ostrich and possibly the Elephant Bird. Unlike other flightless birds, the ratites have no keel on their sternum - hence the name from the Latin ratis (for raft). Without this to anchor their wing muscles, they could not fly even if they were to develop suitable wings.

See also 21 CFR 101.14 [http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=101.14]. A claim is a health claim if in the naming of the substance or category of substances, there is a description or indication of a functionality or an implied effect on health. examples: "contains antioxidants" (the function is an antioxidant effect). "containsprobiotics/prebiotics" (the reference to probiotic/prebiotic implies a health benefit). Equally, claims which refer to an indication of a functionality in the description of a nutrient or a substance (for instance as an adjective to the substance) should also beclassified as a health claim. examples: "with prebiotic fibres" or "contains prebiotic fibres". In Europe, a health claim is any statement about a relationship between food and health [http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/labellingnutrition/claims/health claims en.htm], and only authorized health claims are legal [see http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/labellingnutrition/claims/community register/health claims en.htm].

material entity;owl order;Owls are a group of birds that belong to the order *Strigiformes*, constituting 200 extant bird of prey species. Most are solitary and nocturnal, with some exceptions (e.g., the Northern Hawk Owl). Owls hunt mostly small mammals, insects, and other birds, although a few species specialize in hunting fish. They are found in all regions of the Earth except Antarctica, most of Greenland and some remote islands. Though owls are typically solitary, the literary collective noun for a group of owls is a parliament. Owls are characterized by their small beaks and wide faces, and are divided into two families: the typical owls, *Strigidae*. and the barn-owls, *Tytonidae*.

This is unsupported by more recent research (see *Cypselomorphae* for details), but the relationships of the owls in general are still unresolved. This large family comprises around 189 living species in 25 genera. The typical owls have a cosmopolitan distribution and are found on every continent except Antarctica.

The Welsh onion (*Allium fistulosum*) does not form bulbs even when mature, and is grown in the West almost exclusively as a scallion or salad onion, although in Asia this species is of primary importance and used both fresh and in cooking. "Scallion" is also used for young plants of the common onion (*Allium cepa* var. *cepa*) and shallot (*Allium cepa* var. *aggregatum*, formerly *Allium ascalonicum*), harvested before bulbs form, or sometimes when slight bulbing has occurred. Most of the cultivars grown in the West primarily as salad onions or scallions belong to *Allium cepa* var. *cepa*. Other species sometimes used as scallions include *Allium ×proliferum* and *Allium ×wakegi*.

People often use blanching as a pre-treatment prior to freezing, drying, or canning—heating vegetables or fruits to inactivate enzymes, modify texture, remove the peel, and wilt tissue. Blanching is also utilized to preserve color, flavor, and nutritional value. The process has three stages: preheating, blanching, and cooling. The most common blanching methods for vegetables/fruits are hot water and steam, while cooling is either done using cold water or cool air.

Salmon are capable of going hundreds of kilometers upriver, and humans must install fish ladders in dams to enable the salmon to get past. Catadromous fish live in fresh water, breed in the sea. the most remarkable are freshwater eels of genus Anguilla, whose larvae drift on the open ocean, sometimes for months or years, before travelling thousands of kilometres back to their original streams. Amphidromous fish move between fresh and salt water during some part of life cycle, but not for breeding.

material entity;dolphin family;Dolphins are aquatic mammals related to whales and porpoises Any member of the families *Delphinidae* and *Platanistoidea* (oceanic and river dolphins). Porpoises (suborder *Odontoceti*, family *Phocoenidae*) are thus not dolphins in this sense. Orcas and some related species belong to the *Delphinidae* family and therefore qualify as dolphins, even though they are called whales in common language. There are almost 40 species of dolphin in 17 genera.

They are however distinct from dolphins, although the word "porpoise" is often used to refer to any small dolphin, especially in North America. A key difference is the shape of the teeth and of the head. Porpoises, divided into six species, live in all oceans, mostly near the shore. Probably best known is the Harbour Porpoise, which can be found across the Northern Hemisphere. (

material entity;roe deer;There are two species of Roe Deer. The European Roe Deer (*Capreolus capreolus*), a deer species of Europe and Asia Minor, and the Siberian Roe Deer (*Capreolus pygargus*), found from the Ural Mountains to as far east as China and Siberia. The two species met at the Caucasus Mountains, with the European species occupying the southern flank of the mountain ranges and adjacent Asia Minor and the Siberian species occupying the northern flank of the mountain ranges. Within Europe, the European Roe Deer occurs in most areas, with the exception of northern Scandinavia and some of the islands, notably Iceland, Ireland, and the Mediterranean Sea islands. in the Mediterranean region it is largely confined to mountainous regions, and is absent or rare at low levels. The Roe Deer is a relatively small deer, with a body length of 95-135 cm, a shoulder height of 65-75 cm, and a weight of 15-30 kg. It has rather short, erect antlers and a reddish body with a grey face. Its hide is golden red in summer, darkening to brown or even black in winter, with lighter undersides and a white rump patch. the tail is very short (2-3 cm), and barely visible. Only the males have antlers, which are lost during winter, but which re-grow in time for the mating season.

material entity;zebu;Zebus (*Bos taurus indicus*), sometimes known as 'nothing cattle', are better-adapted to tropical environments than other domestic cattle. Their scientific name was originally *Bos indicus*, but this name is now deemed invalid by ITIS, who classify the zebu under *Bos taurus* along with all other domestic cattle, and their aurochs ancestors, domesticated in India about 10,000 years ago. The ancient species of *Bos nomadicus* cattle or even gaur may have contributed to the development of the zebus. There are some 75 known breeds, split about evenly between African breeds and South Asian ones. The major Zebu cattle breeds of the world include Gyr, Guzerat, Indu-Brazilian, Nellore, Ongole and Brahman. Zebu have humps, large dewlaps and ears. They have more sweat glands than European cattle (*Bos taurus*). They handle hot, humid climates well and have pest resistances not seen in European cattle. (

material entity;cowpea plant;The cowpea (*Vigna unguiculata*) is an annual herbaceous legume from the genus *Vigna. Due to its tolerance for sandy soil and low rainfall it is an important crop in the semi-arid regions across Africa and other countries. It requires very few inputs, as the plants root nodules are able to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it a valuable crop for resource poor farmers and well-suited to intercropping with other crops. The whole plant is used as forage for animals, with its use as cattle feed likely responsible for its name. Four subspecies of cowpea are recognised, of which three are cultivated. Cultivated cowpeas are known by the common names black-eyed pea, southern pea, yardlong bean, catjang, and crowder pea.[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowpea]

material entity;efsa food classification and description system for exposure assessment (efsa foodex2);FoodEx2 is a comprehensive food classification and description system aimed at covering the need to describe food in data collections across different food safety domains. After its first release in 2011, the system was broadly tested in various practical situations, allowing its evaluation and the identification of areas for improvement. The present version in LanguaL is based on the FoodEx2 version Matrix 9.0 dated 2018-01-26 (downloaded 2018-02-07) and comprises the FoodEx2 Exposure Hierarchy. The FoodEx2 browser and FoodEx2 catalogue are available at GitHub: https://github.com/openefsa/catalogue-browser/wiki For further information, see the Data Standardisation pages of the European Food Safety Authority website [https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/data/data-standardisation]. The implementation of EFSA FoodEx2 facet term codes (FTC) in LanguaL follow closely the EFSA FoodEx2 codes. this means that the LanguaL facet term codes for all FoodEx2 descriptors are identical to the original EFSA FoodEx2 codes. EFSA FoodEx2 is top-down prioritised, meaning that descriptors physically higher in the hierarchy within the same level are preferred to descriptors further down, whereas LanguaL in general does not have a preferred order. In the implementation of EFSA FoodEx2 it has therefore been necessary to implement a forced order of the descriptors by preceeding the original FoodEx2 descriptor names by a numeric serialisation indicator (an order number).

The most widely known member is the flat-leaved vanilla (*V. planifolia*), native to Mexico, from which commercial vanilla flavoring is derived. The fruit is termed "vanilla bean", though true beans are fabaceaen eudicots not at all closely related to orchids. Rather, the vanilla fruit is technically an elongate, fleshy and later dehiscent capsule 10-20 cm long. It ripens gradually for 8 to 9 months after flowering, eventually turning black in color and giving off a strong aroma. Each pod contains thousands of minute seeds, and both the pods and seeds within are used to create vanilla flavoring. Vanilla beans are harvested by hand from commercial orchards.

material entity;angelica plant;*Angelica*, is a genus of about 60 species of tall biennial and perennial herbs in the family Apiaceae, native to temperate and subarctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Some species are grown as flavoring agents or for their medicinal properties. The most notable of these is garden angelica (*A. archangelica*), which is commonly known simply as angelica. Natives of Lapland use the fleshy roots as food and the stalks as medicine. Crystallized strips of young angelica stems and midribs are green in colour and are sold as decorative and flavoursome cake decoration material, but may also be enjoyed on their own. The roots and seeds are sometimes used to flavor gin. Its presence accounts for the distinct flavor of many liqueurs, such as Chartreuse.

material entity;sweet corn plant;Sweet corn (*Zea mays* convar. *saccharata* var. *rugosa*. also called Indian corn, sugar corn, and pole corn) is a variety of maize with a high sugar content. Sweet corn is the result of a naturally occurring recessive mutation in the genes which control conversion of sugar to starch inside the endosperm of the corn kernel. Unlike field corn varieties, which are harvested when the kernels are dry and mature (dent stage), sweet corn is picked when immature (milk stage) and prepared and eaten as a vegetable, rather than a grain. Since the process of maturation involves converting sugar to starch, sweet corn stores poorly and must be eaten fresh, canned, or frozen, before the kernels become tough and starchy.

Mandarins are smaller and oblate, rather than spherical like the common oranges (which are a mandarin hybrid). The taste is considered less sour, as well as sweeter and stronger. A ripe mandarin is firm to slightly soft, heavy for its size, and pebbly-skinned. The peel is very thin, with very little bitter white mesocarp, so they are usually easier to peel and to split into segments. Hybrids generally have these traits to a lesser degree.
