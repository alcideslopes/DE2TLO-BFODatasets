object;CAR (canonical)[Ground glass appearance];This gene encodes a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, and is a key regulator of xenobiotic and endobiotic metabolism. The protein binds to DNA as a monomer or a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor and regulates the transcription of target genes involved in drug metabolism and bilirubin clearance, such as cytochrome P450 family members. Unlike most nuclear receptors, this transcriptional regulator is constitutively active in the absence of ligand but is regulated by both agonists and inverse agonists. Ligand binding results in translocation of this protein to the nucleus, where it activates or represses target gene transcription. These ligands include bilirubin, a variety of foreign compounds, steroid hormones, and prescription drugs. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

The 105 kD protein is a Rel protein-specific transcription inhibitor and the 50 kD protein is a DNA binding subunit of the NF-kappa-B (NFKB) protein complex. NFKB is a transcription regulator that is activated by various intra- and extra-cellular stimuli such as cytokines, oxidant-free radicals, ultraviolet irradiation, and bacterial or viral products. Activated NFKB translocates into the nucleus and stimulates the expression of genes involved in a wide variety of biological functions. Inappropriate activation of NFKB has been associated with a number of inflammatory diseases while persistent inhibition of NFKB leads to inappropriate immune cell development or delayed cell growth. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms, at least one of which is proteolytically processed. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2016]

This gene should not be confused with eIF2-alpha (EIF2S1, Gene ID: 1965), the alpha subunit of the eIF2 translation initiation complex. Although both of these proteins function in binding initiator tRNA to the 40 S ribosomal subunit, the encoded protein does so in a codon-dependent manner, whereas eIF2 complex requires GTP. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2016]

process;allowing;Preventing is a type of functioning process of meta-function of "ToPrevent". Two meta-functions "ToAllow" and "ToPrevent" are concerned with the undesirable side effects of functions. A function fa having positive effects on the side effect of a function ft1 is said to have a meta-function “to allow the side-effects of ft1”. The “undesirable side effect” is defined in a relation with another function ft2 or the whole system. The “positive effect” means such a causal relation that increase of the focused attribute of fa causes decrease of the side effect. If a serious trouble (e.g., faults) will be caused in a function ft2 when a function fa is not achieved, function fa is said to have a meta-function “to prevent malfunction of ft2”. For example, the “to super-heat” function of the boiler prevents malfunction of the turbine, because the steam of low temperature would damage the turbine blade by water particles. For almost all fa performing a ToAllow meta-function for ft1, in general, there exists a ToPrevent meta-function for another function ft2.
