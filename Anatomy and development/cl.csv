material entity;kidney cortex collecting duct intercalated cell;Any renal intercalated cell that is part of some cortical collecting duct.
material entity;kidney cortex collecting duct principal cell;Any renal principal cell that is part of some cortical collecting duct.
material entity;kidney outer medulla collecting duct intercalated cell;Intercalated cell that is part of some outer medullary collecting duct. It is known in some mammalian species that this cell may contribute in the maintenance of acid/base homeostasis.
material entity;kidney outer medulla collecting duct principal cell;Principal cell that is part of some outer medullary collecting duct. It is known in some mammalian species that this cell may express the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC).
material entity;kidney inner medulla collecting duct intercalated cell;Any renal intercalated cell that is part of some inner medullary collecting duct.
material entity;kidney inner medulla collecting duct principal cell;Any renal principal cell that is part of some inner medullary collecting duct.
material entity;posterior cone cell (sensu Endopterygota);
material entity;compound eye cone cell;A cell of an ommatidium that secretes lens materials.
material entity;stratum granulosum cell;Any epidermal cell that is part of some stratum granulosum of epidermis.
material entity;cumulus cell;Cumulus cell is a specialized granulosa cell that surrounds and nourishes the oocyte. This cell-type surrounds the fully-grown oocyte to form a cumulus-oocyte complex (abbr. COC). The terms cumulus oophorus cells, cumulus granulosa cells, cumulus oophorous granulosa cells, granulosa-cumulus cells are used to make a distinction between this cell and the other functionally different subpopulation of granulosa cells at the wall of the Graafian follicle.
material entity;neurecto-epithelial cell;Epithelial cells derived from neural plate and neural crest.
material entity;lymph gland crystal cell;A crystal cell that derives from the larval lymph gland.
material entity;embryonic crystal cell;A crystal cell that derives from the embryonic head mesoderm.
material entity;corona radiata cell;
material entity;kidney pelvis smooth muscle cell;Any smooth muscle cell that is part of some kidney pelvis smooth muscle.
material entity;kidney pelvis urothelial cell;Any kidney epithelial cell that is part of some kidney pelvis urothelium.
material entity;ureter urothelial cell;Any urothelial cell that is part of some urothelium of ureter.
material entity;ureter adventitial cell;Any ureteral cell that is part of some adventitia of ureter.
