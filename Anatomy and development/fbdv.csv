occurrent;pharate adult stage P11;Thoracic bristles become visible, and the tips of the wings turn grey. Duration at 25 degrees C: approximately 2 hours. (194.6-196.6 hours after egg laying. 74.6-76.6 hours after puparium formation).
occurrent;pharate adult stage P8;Pale yellow pigmentation spreads inwards across the eye. Eye color becomes bright yellow, then changes to amber. Duration at 25 degrees C: approximately 12 hours 20 minutes. (164.3-176.6 hours after egg laying. 44.3-56.6 hours after puparium formation).
occurrent;pharate adult stage P9;Eye color darkens to deep amber, then becomes pale pink. Duration at 25 degrees C: approximately 18 hours. (176.6-194.5 hours after egg laying. 56.6-74.5 hours after puparium formation).
occurrent;pharate adult stage P11(i);Dorsal thoracic microchaetes and macrochaetes become visible. Duration at 25 degrees C: approximately 80 minutes (194.6-195.5 hours after egg laying. 74.6-75.9 hours after puparium formation).

occurrent;prepupal stage;The prepupal stage begins at puparium formation and ends when larval/pupal apolysis is complete, as indicated by the completion of imaginal head sac eversion and the expulsion of the oral armature of the larva. Duration at 25 degrees C: approximately 12 hours. (120-132.2 hours after egg laying. 0-12.2 hours after puparium formation).
occurrent;prepupal stage P1;Extends from puparium formation through tanning of the pupal cuticle. Posterior spiracles and ridge between anterior spiracles tan orange. Wriggling stops completely. Puparium becomes brown to the unaided eye. Duration at 25 degrees C: approximately 20 minutes. (120-120.3 hours after egg laying. 0-0.3 hours after puparium formation).
occurrent;early third instar larval stage;Third instar larva prior to the wandering stage (approximately the first 24 hours of the third instar larval stage under standard conditions at 25'C.).
occurrent;wandering third instar larval stage;Stage of the third larval instar during which the larva wanders out of the food and climbs. Under optimum conditions at 25'C, this occurs approximately 24 hours after the start of the third instar larval stage.
occurrent;day 14 of adulthood;14th day after eclosion.
occurrent;prepupal stage P4;Prepupal stage P4 begins as the lateral trunk trachea become obscured and ends when the imaginal head sac is everted and the oral armature of the larva is expelled. Duration at 25 degrees C: approximately 5 hours, 30 minutes. (126.75-132.2 hours after egg laying. 6.75-12.2 hours after puparium formation).
occurrent;prepupal stage P4(i);Lateral trunk tracheae become obscured. Dorsal medial abdominal contractions occur. Everted leg and wing discs become visible. Bubble appears in posterior of puparium, displacing the pupa anteriorly. abdominal bubble disappears. Duration at 25 degrees C: approximately 5 hours, 15 minutes. (126.75-132 hours after egg laying. 6.75-12 hours after puparium formation).
occurrent;prepupal stage P2;Male gonads become less distinct. Oral armature stops moving permanently. Dorsal medial abdominal contractions stop. Gas bubble becomes visible within abdomen. Duration at 25 degrees C: approximately 100 minutes. (120.3-122 hours after egg laying. 0.3-2 hours after puparium formation).
occurrent;prepupal stage P3;Ridge of the operculum becomes distinct. Puparium begins to separate from underlying epidermis. Becomes positively buoyant. Duration at 25 degrees C: approximately 4 hours, 45 minutes. (122-126.75 hours after egg laying. 2-6.75 hours after puparium formation).
occurrent;prepupal stage P4(ii);Bubble is displaced to anterior end of the puparium, and pupa withdraws to the posterior end. Imaginal head sac is everted and the oral armature of the larva is expelled. Duration at 25 degrees C: approximately 12 minutes. (132-132.2 hours after egg laying. 12-12.2 hours after puparium formation).
occurrent;pupal stage;The pupal stage starts once larval/pupal apolysis is complete as indicated by the expulsion of the larval armature. Early in this stage, the legs and wings reach full extension along the abdomen. The stage ends when the pupal cuticle separates from the underlying epidermis (pupal/adult apolysis), and the eye cup becomes yellow at its periphery. Duration at 25 degrees C: approximately 32 hours. (132.2-164.3 hours after egg laying. 12.2-44.3 hours after puparium formation).
