generically dependent continuant;rejected;A confidence statement from single evidence related to assertions that have been rejected, for instance, following paper retraction, author misinterpretation, or curator misinterpretation.
generically dependent continuant;confidence statement from congruent evidence lines of same type;Confidence statement from multiple evidence lines of same type, that are all congruent.
generically dependent continuant;different type;An evidence type concordance for evidence lines that are from different types.
generically dependent continuant;confidence information statement;A statement providing information about the confidence in an assertion, meaning, an information about the level of certainty that an assertion is correct.

generically dependent continuant;confidence statement from weakly conflicting evidence lines of same type;Confidence statement from conflicting evidence lines of same type, where evidence lines are in weak contradiction, meaning that the overall supported assertion is believed to be true, but a subset of less-reliable evidence lines are in contradiction.
