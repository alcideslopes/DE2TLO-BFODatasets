realizable entity;Inability to communicate;A symptom of failure to communicate with others.
disposition;traumatic brain injury;Traumatic brain injury usually results from a violent blow or jolt to the head or body. An object that goes through brain tissue, such as a bullet or shattered piece of skull, also can cause traumatic brain injury.
realizable entity;cognitive symptom;Cognitive symptoms involve problems with concentration and memory and can be just as disabling as the other types of symptoms. The onset of cognitive symptoms is usually realised in the same way as negative symptoms in that they only begin to be noticeable after the dominance of psychotic episodes or positive symptoms have either been controlled with medication or diminished with age.
process;Xiusanzhen;An acupuncture method that involves pucture at bilateral Yingxiang and Yintang points
process;Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ);A questionaire with 10 items that can be easily administered by clinicians in mental impairment diagnosis
process;Late-stage Alzheimer's Disease(severe);A disease at late stage where dementia symptoms are severe. Individuals lose the ability to respond to their environment, to carry on a conversation and, eventually, to control movement. They may still say words or phrases, but communicating pain becomes difficult. As memory and cognitive skills continue to worsen, significant personality changes may take place and individuals need extensive care.
process;Neurobehavioral Cognitive Status Examination;A screening examination that assesses cognition in a brief but quantitative fashion, uses independent tests to evaluate functioning within five major cognitive ability areas: language, constructions, memory, calculations, and reasoning.
process;tobacco consumption;A behavior of consuming tabacco products
generically dependent continuant;amyloid-beta 42/amyloid-beta 40 ratio;A ratio between amyloid-beta 42 and amyloid-beta 40. Decreased ratio of amyloid-beta 42/40 is a strong marker of Alzheimer's disease.
process;Brief Alzheimer Screen test;A test developed from cognitive assessments on 406 normal subjects and 342 mild AD patients in the CERAD (Consortium to Establish a Registry for AD) dataset.
generically dependent continuant;beta-secretase 1 measurement;A measurement that quantifies the amount of beta-secretase 1 (BACE1) normally found in blood or cerebrospinal fluid. The quantification of the amount of beta-secretase 1 in a sample, typicallly cerebrospinal fluid. Beta-secretase-1 is an aspartic-acid protease important in the formation of myelin sheaths in peripheral nerve cells, and is thought to have a role in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.

process;Middle-stage Alzheimer's Disease (moderate);A disease in the middle stage where the dementia symptoms are more pronounced. The person may confuse words, get frustrated or angry, and act in unexpected ways, such as refusing to bathe. Damage to nerve cells in the brain can also make it difficult for the person to express thoughts and perform routine tasks without assistance.

entity;early sign;A sign that arises in the early/preclinical stage of a disease
