The formula: | (reference genome size - assembly genome size) | / reference genome size This yeilds a decimal / percentage ranging from 0 = exact length, to say .1 which is equivalent to a 10% variance. If the ratio is too far from a quality control ratio that depends on the species in question, this indicates a bad assembly or a mis-identified sample.
generically dependent continuant;genome size delta ratio QC threshold;This is the upper acceptable limit of the 'genome size delta ratio' with respect to a particular species. For Salmonella a 0.10 variance in length between an assembly size and a reference genome size may be acceptable.

two-dimensional continuant fiat boundary;contig N50 length QC threshold;The contig N50 length QC threshold is a minimum length threshold that a contig N50 length datum should be above for good QC. A lower length is indicative of assembly problems (insufficient read depth) or a mismatched reference genome.

This threshold avoids having too many gene coding regions prematurely clipped inside short contigs. An assembly having 1% or more of its content in less than 2Kbp chunks is cause for concern. Bacterial genes are generally about 1Kbp in length.
