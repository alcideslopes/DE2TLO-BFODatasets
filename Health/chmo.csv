process;1H–15N heteronuclear multiple bond coherence;A type of heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy where a second frequency dimension is employed to disperse the signals and reveal correlations between protons and 15N nuclei which are 2 to 3 bonds removed.

Only the magnetisation of the 15N nucleus is allowed to evolve.
process;X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy;X-ray absorption spectroscopy where changes in the X-ray absorption coefficient around the absorption edge (the part of the spectrum where the incident X-ray energy matches the binding energy of an electron) are measured as a function of incident X-ray energy.

process;bright-field transmission electron microscopy;Microscopy where an electron-transparent specimen is bombarded with a finely focused (<10 nm diameter) electron beam with an acceleration voltage 50–150 kV. under vacuum. The beam of electrons passes directly through an aperture before reaching the specimen. The image results from a weakening of the direct beam by its interaction with the sample.
process;X-ray absorption spectroscopy;Spectroscopy where the sample is bombarded with X-rays and the X-ray absorption coefficient of the sample is measured. When the incident X-ray energy matches the binding energy of an electron in an atom there is a decrease in the intensity of transmitted X-rays resulting in an absorption edge.
process;93Nb nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy;Spectroscopy where the energy states of 93Rb nuclei placed in a static magnetic field are interrogated by inducing transitions between the states via radio frequency irradiation. Each experiment consists of a sequence of radio frequency pulses with delay periods in between them.
process;dark-field transmission electron microscopy;Microscopy where an electron-transparent specimen is bombarded with a finely focused (<10 nm diameter) electron beam with an acceleration voltage 50–150 kV. under vacuum. The beam of electrons is scattered or diffracted before reaching the specimen, and the image results from a weakening of the beam by its interaction with the sample.
process;X-ray spectroscopy;Spectroscopy where the absorption or emission of X-rays is detected.
process;93Nb solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy;Spectroscopy where the energy states 93Nb nuclei in a solid sample placed in a static magnetic field are interrogated by inducing transitions between the states via radio frequency irradiation. Each experiment consists of a sequence of radio frequency pulses with delay periods in between them.
process;dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy;Microscopy where a finely focused (<10 nm diameter) electron beam with an acceleration voltage 50–150 kV is scanned across an electron-transparent specimen under vacuum. The beam of electrons is scattered or diffracted before reaching the specimen, and the image results from a weakening of the beam by its interaction with the sample.
process;vacuum ultraviolet spectrophotometry;Spectroscopy where the sample absorbs radiation in the vacuum ultraviolet region (0.1-200 nm) resulting in electronic transitions within the sample.
process;1H magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy;Spectroscopy where the energy states of 1H nuclei placed in a static magnetic field are interrogated by inducing transitions between the states via radio frequency irradiation. Each experiment consists of a sequence of radio frequency pulses with delay periods between them. Anisotropic interactions between nuclei, which are usually averaged by Brownian motion in liquid samples, cause significant line broadening in solid-state NMR, but can be averaged to zero by spinning the sample very rapidly at the magic angle (54.74° with respect to the direction of the magnetic field).
material entity;Knudsen cell;A piece of apparatus, consisting of a crucible (made of pyrolytic boron nitride, quartz, tungsten or graphite), heating filaments, a water cooling system, which is used to measure very low vapor pressures by measuring the mass of vapor which escapes when the vessel contains a liquid in equilibrium with its vapor. It is also used as a source evaporator during crystal growth e.g. during molecular-beam epitaxy.
